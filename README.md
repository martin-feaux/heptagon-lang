Syntax highlighting is supported, that's being said there is probably some construction/keywords who are not matched or correctly colored.

### Semantic Highlighting

Not supported yet and probably never.

### Snippet

A few snippets already exist and others will be added over the time.

### Hover

Being implemented

### Methode signature helper

Is currently implemented but will be reworked when hover is completed.

Comming with hover.

None yet but will be added if compile and run is added.
